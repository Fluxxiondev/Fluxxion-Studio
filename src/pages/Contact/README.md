Contact page

A lightweight React contact page component with client-side validation and subtle motion feedback.

Usage
- Copy `src/pages/Contact/Contact.jsx` and `Contact.css` into your project.
- Import in your router or page index: `import Contact from './pages/Contact/Contact'` and render it.

Notes
- This component simulates form submission with a timeout. Wire it up to your backend or service (Netlify Forms, Formspree) as needed.
